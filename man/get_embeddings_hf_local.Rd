\title{Generate Text Embeddings using HuggingFace Models Locally}
\usage{
get_embeddings_hf_local(
  text,
  model = "dwulff/mpnet-personality",
  python_env = NULL,
  install_packages = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{text}{Character vector. One or more texts to be transformed into embeddings.}

\item{model}{Character. The embedding model to use (default: 'dwulff/mpnet-personality').}

\item{python_env}{Character. Python environment to use. If NULL, uses default reticulate environment.}

\item{install_packages}{Logical. Whether to automatically install required Python packages (default: TRUE).}
}
\value{
A data frame where each row represents an embedding vector for the corresponding input text.
}
\description{
This function generates text embeddings using HuggingFace's sentence-transformers library
running locally via Python. It allows access to models not available via the Inference API.
}
\details{
This function uses the reticulate package to interface with Python's sentence-transformers library.
It will automatically install the required packages if they're not available.

The function downloads the model on first use, which may take some time depending on model size.
Subsequent calls with the same model will be faster as the model is cached locally.
